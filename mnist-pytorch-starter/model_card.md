# 🧬 Model Card: Image Classifier

## 📌 Intended Use

This model is designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of 10 categories. It is meant for educational purposes and early experimentation with CNNs.

## 🛠️ Architecture

- Convolutional layers: 2
- Dense layers: 1 hidden, 1 output
- Activations: ReLU, Softmax

## 🎯 Training Details

- Dataset: CIFAR-10
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: CrossEntropy
- Epochs: 50

## 📊 Performance

- Accuracy: 87%
- Confusion matrix, F1 score (include visual if possible)

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Not robust to adversarial noise
- Trained on small dataset (limited generalization)
